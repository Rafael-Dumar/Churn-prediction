# Predictive Customer Churn API with FastAPI

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen)

## üìñ Project Description
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Using a dataset with demographic and service-related features, the objective was to build a robust classification model and deploy it as a real-time API.

The final deliverable is a high-performance **web API built with FastAPI**. This API can receive data for a single customer and instantly return their probability of churning, making it ready for integration with other applications like a CRM or a customer support dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual investigation of the main churn drivers using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`.
* **Robust Preprocessing:** Handling of missing data by comparing different strategies (dropping vs. imputation).
* **Feature Engineering:** Encoding of categorical variables with `One-Hot Encoding` and scaling of numerical features with `StandardScaler`.
* **Comparative Model Analysis:** Training and evaluation of multiple algorithms, including `Logistic Regression` and `XGBoost`.
* **API Development:** The best-performing model is served via a production-ready API using **FastAPI**.
* **Interactive Documentation:** The API includes automatically generated, interactive documentation via Swagger UI.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **XGBoost:** For modeling with Gradient Boosting.
- **Joblib:** For serializing model artifacts.
- **FastAPI:** For building the high-performance API.
- **Uvicorn:** As the ASGI server to run the API.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The repository is organized to separate the exploratory analysis from the final, deployable application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Project

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies in a virtual environment.

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-REPO-NAME].git

# Navigate to the directory
cd [YOUR-REPO-NAME]

# Create and activate the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate | Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Training the Model : train.py
This step only needs to be run once. It will process the data and save the necessary .pkl files.

2. Running the API Server
With the model artifacts created, you can now start the API server using Uvicorn.

uvicorn app:app --reload
The server will be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

3. Testing the API
The easiest way to test the API is by using the interactive documentation automatically generated by FastAPI.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Click on the POST /predict_churn endpoint to expand it.

Click on "Try it out". The request body will be pre-filled with an example.

Edit the example JSON with the customer data you want to classify.

Click "Execute". The API's prediction will be shown in the "Server response" section.

üìä Results and Conclusion
After the exploration phase, the Logistic Regression model was identified as the best-performing out-of-the-box, with an accuracy of 81.32%. A deeper investigation with an optimized XGBoost model did not yield a significant performance increase, reinforcing the choice of the simpler model.

Final Conclusion:
The Logistic Regression model was selected as the final solution due to its superior combination of performance and simplicity for this dataset. This model was then deployed via a FastAPI application, demonstrating a complete pipeline from raw data to a functional, real-time prediction service.
